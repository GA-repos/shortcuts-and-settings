# Shortcuts-and-Setting

As a burgeoning web developer, you have a lot to learn. One really critical thing to focus on is starting good habits today. If you teach yourself the best ways to do things now, you won't have to go back and correct yourself later.  You'll also learn to code faster and have a better workflow, where you won't lose minutes switching between applications and windows. Utilizing keyboard shortcuts will also help you type faster and let you focus on the task at hand.

A lot of these steps will feel awkward at first, but the more you use them, the sooner they'll become second nature.  Part of succeeding is just taking a deep breath and taking a moment to practice the better way, then it'll get easier and easier.

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of little things you can do to make you a more effective coder. Here we're going to focus on a small group of things that will have the biggest impact for being ready for this course.
